description: >
  Inspired by other music/audio programming languages such as PPMCK, LilyPond
  and ChucK, Alda aims to be a powerful and flexible programming language for
  the musician who wants to easily compose and generate music on the fly, using
  naught but a text editor. Alda is designed in a way that equally favors
  aesthetics, flexibility and ease of use, with (eventual) support for the
  text-based creation of all manner of music: classical, popular, chiptune,
  electroacoustic, and more!
